# 🏦 Loan Eligibility & Credit Scoring ML Platform

An end-to-end Machine Learning system that predicts loan eligibility and credit risk using a FastAPI backend, Streamlit frontend, and Dockerized deployment.

This project demonstrates how ML models are taken from training to real-time production inference with proper engineering practices.
